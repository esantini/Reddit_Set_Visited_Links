# Reddit_Set_Visited_Links

Only for RES users when navigating the front page, /r/all, or any subreddit..

Sets the link as 'visited' when using the 'Expand' button on text-posts, twitter links, i.redd.it and maybe more I haven't noticed.

Not working with some external links like youtube or i.reddituploads.com

Put it on the console or in your scripts in Tampermonkey or other extensions like that.

Tested only in Chrome.
